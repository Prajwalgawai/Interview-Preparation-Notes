Real Time Chat Application : 
I have created 3 projects out of them my Bigger project is Real time chat application which is more similar to the facebook messenger.
The primary purpose of this project was to create a platform where users can have real-time conversations. This was motivated by the need for instantaneous communication in various scenarios such as social media and all.

Technical Stack and Architecture
**"The project is built on the MERN stack.

MongoDB: Used for storing user data and chat history.
Express: Serves as the backend framework, handling API requests and server-side logic. (what happens when we enter the url on the browser).
React: Provides a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Node.js: Serves as the runtime environment for the server-side code.
Socket.IO: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server, facilitating instant message delivery."**
Redux: Manages the application state in a predictable way, particularly handling the complex state logic and ensuring that the state is consistent across different components.

Features and functionality : 
User Authentication: Users can register and login using the secure authentication and credentials are encrypted using BcryptJs.
Real-Time Messaging: Instant message delivery in chats using Socket.IO.
Message Persistence: Chat history is stored in MongoDB, allowing users to see previous messages when they re-enter a chat window.
Realtime Seen-Unseen functionality : users can see whether their message is seen by the another person or not.
Typing Indicators: Users can see when others are typing, enhancing the real-time experience.
User Status: Online/offline status indicators for users.
Delete for Me/delete for Both functionality : User can delete the msg sent by him from his own chat as well as from both person's chats.

Difficulties faced during project : Real time functionality, sending images.

Key learning : This project significantly enhanced my understanding of real-time web applications and full-stack development. Using Redux taught me the importance of centralized state management in handling complex state logic and ensuring a consistent state across the application, I learn how to handle the api requests, how to create the appealing user interfaces, and how to implement the Socket functionality.

//why this project : I created this project because during our third year we had a operating system subject so during it's practical our professor used to tell us to learn react js and socket.io while Learning it I thought why not to create a full stack application using MERN Stack and Socket.IO.

//why didn't you use any lattest technology in your project ?
"The main reason we didn't use the latest technologies like AI, ML, or DL in our project is that the primary goal was to create a reliable and efficient real-time chat application. Incorporating AI or ML would have added unnecessary complexity and deviated from the core functionality we needed.

Is it the business purpose project?

what is the future scope for this project ?
